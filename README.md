# FileBird - FTP manager for broadcast services

# Notes


* Currently the FTP password is stored in plain text in the DB, this will be fixed soon, but due to time it is not implimented properly.
* you need to run redis on your server

# setup

app can be deployed with capistrano

1. make your server
2. Set database.yml with your info (we're using postgresql)
3. navigate to server after app is online and enter in an ftp server /settings
4. navigate to /downloaders and enter in some info
  1. you need a leading slash (/) on the FTP file path

# ToDo

- [ ] add a real logging system
